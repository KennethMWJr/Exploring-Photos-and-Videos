# Project Overview
Prior to learning how to build apps and pursuing a career in the tech industry, I had interacted with community gardens and gardeners regularly in a support capacity.   It had been at least 2 months since I interacted with a community garden before starting this project and it's around autumn. The content is largely motivated by my nostalgia for nature and my previous experience with community gardens. In this project, users will view photos and videos along with audio of nature from the Pixabay API.

## Project Description
The user can view photos and videos oF nature provided by the Pixabay API. Audio is provided with the videos. They are on loop to create an immersive effect that should make a user feel a sense of nature in a meditative-like manner.
